This is the functional and structural MRI data used for the following two studies:

Jahfari, S., Ridderinkhof, K. R., Collins, A.G.E, Knapen, T., Waldorp, L. J., Frank, M. J. (2019). Cross-Task Contributions of Frontobasal Ganglia Circuitry in Response Inhibition and Conflict-Induced Slowing. Cerebral Cortex, Volume 29, Issue 5, Pages 1969â€“1983, https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhy076.

Jahfari, S., Theeuwes, J., Knapen, T. (2019). Learning in visual regions as support for the bias in future value-driven choice. bioRxiv, 523340.

Folders are organised by subject number (e.g. sub-01). Within each folder there are subfolders with the following:

1) anat - T1-weighted structural scan

2) func - contains functional scans for: 
- A probabilistic selection task with faces used as stimuli. This task includes 3 learning phase scans, and 3 test phase scans.
- A modified stop-signal task with faces as go stimuli. 
- a PPA, FFA, LO mapper.

3) dwi - 2 diffusion-weighted imaging scans, with corresponding bvec and bval. 

Please note that not all participants finished all tasks, or scans. See papers for a description.
